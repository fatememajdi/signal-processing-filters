# Voice Signal Filtering

This project applies various digital filters to voice signals for the purpose of noise reduction and signal enhancement. Implemented filters include:

- Butterworth filter
- FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter
- IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filter
- Other classic signal processing techniques

## Features

- Load and visualize audio signals
- Apply and compare multiple filters
- Plot frequency and time domain representations
- Save and play filtered audio

## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Librosa or Wave (optional for audio I/O)

## Usage

Clone the repository and run the notebook or Python scripts:

`bash
git clone https://github.com/fatememajdi/signal-processing-filters.git
